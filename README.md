# Sections

      This section displays the features of a product - including the styles, price, color, and sizing.
      The product may be viewed more closely via zoom features by clicking on the displayed image.
      Various other clickable styles of a product may be selected in the style selection space.
      An image carousel and arrow buttons may be used to switch between different photos of the style.
      The products may be added to a cart for later checkout. Users can share the product to different social media platforms.

2. Other Products:
      This section displays other products available for sale, which are clickable to change the selected product.

3. Reviews & Ratings:
      This section displays the overall ratings and reviews of the product posted by users.
      The ratings are filterable by clicking on the star ratings, drop-down bar, and entering text in the search bar.
      Clicking on the 'MORE REVIEWS' button displays 2 more reviews each time in a scrollable section.
      Users may mark the helpfulness of reviews.
      Clicking on the 'ADD A REVIEW' button opens a form that allows the user to input their review/ratings.
      Various inputs of the form are mandatory (marked by asterisks), and will not submit if not met.
      When adding a review, users may upload photos, which can be clicked on and expanded.

4. Questions & Answers:
      This section displays the questions and answers of the products, in order of most to least helpfulness.

*Dark Mode*:
      A dark mode button with a moon icon on the top right screen will follow the user as they scroll down.
